## The Enterprise Mindset

Enterprise sales isn't about selling—it's about orchestrating organizational change. Every call is a strategic move in a complex campaign.

The account executives closing seven-figure deals aren't just salespeople. They're business consultants, project managers, and political navigators rolled into one.

**Ready to play at enterprise level?** Start treating every call like a board meeting. Prepare like a consultant. Document like a lawyer. Follow up like your commission depends on it—because it does.

Enterprise deals aren't won by the best product. They're won by the best process.
