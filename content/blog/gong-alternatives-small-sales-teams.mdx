# Gong Alternatives for Small Sales Teams

Looking for gong alternatives? You're not alone. While Gong is a powerful platform, its enterprise pricing and complexity often overwhelm smaller teams. Here are the best alternatives that deliver results without the headaches.

## Why Teams Seek Gong Alternatives

### The Price Problem

- Hidden costs: Implementation, training, add-ons
- Annual contracts with no flexibility
- Per-seat pricing that punishes growth

### The Complexity Challenge

- Requires dedicated admin resources
- Overwhelming feature set for most teams
- Steep learning curve reduces adoption
