# How to Scale Your Sales Team from 10 to 100 Without Losing Your Mind

Growing a sales team from 10 to 100 reps is where most companies fail. Here's the exact playbook used by companies that scaled successfully without losing culture, quality, or their minds.

## The Scaling Death Trap

### Why Most Companies Fail at Scale

**The 10-Person Team That Works:**

- Communication is instant
- Culture happens naturally
- Quality control is easy
- Management is simple

**The 100-Person Chaos:**

- Culture dilutes
- Quality plummets
- Management overwhelmed

**The Typical Results:**
- Productivity drops 40%
- Win rates decline 35%
- Turnover triples
- Culture dies
- Founders burn out

- Management: $15K
- **Total: $175K**

**Revenue per Rep (Target):**
- Year 1: $500K

**The Math for 100 Reps:**
- Investment: $17.5M

### The Hiring Plan

**The Waterfall Model:**
- Month 1: Hire 5, 0 productive
- Month 2: Hire 5, 0 productive
- Month 3: Hire 5, 0 productive
- Month 4: Hire 5, Month 1 hires productive
- Continue pattern

**Always be hiring 3 months ahead of need**

## Common Scaling Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hiring Too Fast
**Problem:** Quality drops, culture breaks
**Solution:** Never compromise standards

### Mistake 2: Under-Investing in Enablement
**Problem:** Ramp time explodes
**Solution:** 1 enablement per 25 reps

### Mistake 3: Promoting Without Training
**Problem:** Great reps become bad managers
**Solution:** Management training mandatory

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Technology
**Problem:** Manual processes don't scale
**Solution:** Automate before you need to

### Mistake 5: Losing Touch
**Problem:** Leadership disconnects from field
**Solution:** Regular field time mandatory

## The Bottom Line

Scaling from 10 to 100 reps isn't about doing the same things bigger – it's about fundamental transformation at each stage. The companies that succeed plan for scale before they need it, invest in systems and people, and never compromise on culture.

**The stakes:** Get it right and you build a unicorn. Get it wrong and you build a disaster.
