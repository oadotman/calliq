# Account Executive Time Management: A Practical Guide to Hitting 150% of Quota

The best Account Executives don't work 80-hour weeks. They work 45 focused hours and hit 150% of quota. Here's the exact time management system used by AEs who consistently outperform while maintaining work-life balance.

## The AE Time Management Crisis

### Where AE Time Actually Goes

**The Average AE's Week (50 hours):**
- 11 hours: Internal meetings
- 9 hours: Email
- 8 hours: CRM admin
- 7 hours: Proposal creation
- 6 hours: Prospecting
- 5 hours: Actually selling
- 4 hours: Random interruptions

**The Top Performer's Week (45 hours):**
- 20 hours: Selling activities
- 8 hours: Strategic account planning
- 6 hours: Pipeline management
- 5 hours: Key meetings only
- 4 hours: Email/admin (batched)
- 2 hours: Skill development

The difference? Ruthless prioritization and systematic execution.

## The Revenue-First Time Framework

### The 80/20 Rule for AEs

**80% of Revenue Comes From:**
- 20% of your accounts
- 20% of your activities
- 20% of your time investment

**Focus Allocation:**
```
TIER 1 ACCOUNTS (60% of time):
- $100K+ opportunities
- Strategic accounts
- Expansion opportunities
- Renewal risks

TIER 2 ACCOUNTS (30% of time):
- $25-100K opportunities
- Qualified pipeline
- High probability deals

TIER 3 ACCOUNTS (10% of time):
- &lt;$25K opportunities
- Early stage
- Low probability
```

### The Time Block System

**The Perfect AE Week:**

**Monday: Pipeline & Planning**
- 8:00-10:00: Pipeline review & forecasting
- 10:00-12:00: Account planning for week
- 1:00-3:00: Team meetings & alignment
- 3:00-5:00: Proposal development

**Tuesday-Thursday: Revenue Generation**
- 8:00-10:00: Power calling block
- 10:00-12:00: Customer meetings
- 1:00-3:00: Demos/presentations
- 3:00-5:00: Follow-ups & advances

**Friday: Closing & Admin**
- 8:00-10:00: Deal closing activities
- 10:00-12:00: Contract negotiations
- 1:00-3:00: CRM updates & admin
- 3:00-5:00: Next week planning

## The Meeting Management System

### Eliminating Time Waste

**Meetings to Decline:**
- "Pick your brain" requests
- Vendor pitches you didn't request
- Meetings without agendas
- Status updates (use email)
- Team meetings you don't contribute to

**The 30-Minute Rule:**
Default all meetings to 30 minutes. Need more? Prove it.

**Meeting Templates:**

**Discovery Call (30 min):**
- 2 min: Rapport & agenda
- 20 min: Discovery questions
- 5 min: Qualification
- 3 min: Next steps

**Demo Call (45 min):**
- 5 min: Recap & agenda
- 30 min: Tailored demo
- 7 min: Questions
- 3 min: Clear next steps

**Negotiation Call (30 min):**
- 5 min: Positions stated
- 20 min: Value discussion
- 5 min: Agreement/next steps

## The Email Efficiency System

### Inbox Zero for AEs

**The 4 D's:**
- **Delete:** Doesn't require action
- **Delegate:** Someone else should handle
- **Do:** Takes &lt;2 minutes
- **Defer:** Schedule time to handle

**Email Templates That Save Hours:**

**The "Not Qualified" Response:**
```

Thanks for your interest. Based on what you've shared, I don't think we're the right fit because [specific reason].

I'd recommend looking at [alternative solution] which better matches your needs.

If things change and you [specific criteria], please reach out.

Best,
[Name]
```

**The "Stalled Deal" Revival:**
```

Been thinking about our conversation regarding [specific challenge discussed].

[Similar customer] just achieved [specific result] using our approach.

Still interested in [specific outcome they wanted]?

If priorities have changed, no worries—just let me know so I can close the loop.

```

**The "Meeting Request" Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Happy to chat. To make our time valuable, could you share:

2. What you're hoping to accomplish?
3. Who else would be involved?

Once I understand the context, I'll send over some times.

Thanks,

Time is your only real asset. Protect it like your income depends on it—because it does.

**Ready to transform?** Tomorrow, decline one meeting, automate one task, and focus one hour. Do this daily. Watch your results soar while your stress plummets.

The path to 150% of quota isn't through more hours—it's through better hours.
