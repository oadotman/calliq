- Admin access to your CRM

- Call recording solution in place
- 30 minutes for initial setup

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Choose Your Integration Method

**Option A: Native Integration (Recommended)**
- Direct API connection
- Real-time synchronization
- Most reliable method

**Option B: Webhook Integration**
- Event-driven updates
- Flexible configuration
- Good for custom fields

**Option C: Zapier/Make Integration**
- No-code solution
- Quick setup
- Limited customization

### Step 2: Configure Field Mapping

Map your call data to CRM fields:

```javascript
const fieldMapping = {
  callTranscript: 'custom_call_notes__c',
  callDuration: 'call_duration__c',
  callOutcome: 'disposition__c',
  nextSteps: 'next_steps__c',
  competitorMentions: 'competitors__c',
  budgetDiscussed: 'budget_range__c',
  decisionTimeline: 'decision_date__c'
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Automation Rules

Define when and how data flows:
- **Trigger**: Call ends
- **Condition**: Duration > 2 minutes
- **Action**: Extract data → Map fields → Update CRM

### Step 4: Implement Data Extraction

Use AI to extract key information:
- Pain points mentioned
- Budget discussions
- Next steps agreed
- Stakeholders identified
- Objections raised
- Competitors discussed

### Step 5: Test and Validate

1. Make test call
2. Verify data capture
3. Check CRM update
4. Confirm accuracy
5. Adjust mapping if needed

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Field Creation

- **Call Intelligence Score** (0-100)
- **Buying Signals Count** (Number)
- **Risk Indicators** (Multi-select)
- **Champion Identified** (Checkbox)
- **Next Meeting Scheduled** (Date)

### Workflow Automation

Trigger automated actions based on call data:
- High interest → Create follow-up task
- Budget mentioned → Update opportunity
- Objection raised → Alert manager
- Competitor mentioned → Flag for competitive team

## ROI Calculator

### Time Savings
- Manual entry time: 15 min/call
- Calls per day: 8
- Daily savings: 2 hours
- Annual value: $15,600/rep

### Data Quality Improvement
- Accuracy increase: 60% → 95%
- Complete records: 40% → 100%
- Faster follow-up: 24hrs → 2hrs

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Solution**: Implement deduplication logic based on call ID

### Issue: Missing Fields
**Solution**: Create custom fields before mapping

### Issue: Sync Delays
**Solution**: Use webhooks instead of polling

### Issue: Data Formatting
**Solution**: Add transformation layer before CRM update

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic fields, add complexity gradually
2. **Monitor Quality**: Regular audits of automated data
3. **Train Team**: Ensure reps understand what's being captured
4. **Iterate**: Continuously improve extraction rules
5. **Document**: Keep configuration documentation updated

## Security Considerations

- Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Encrypt data in transit
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with data regulations

## Measuring Success

Track these KPIs:
- **Adoption Rate**: Target 100%
