8:30-9:00: Team meeting (Non-selling)
9:00-9:20: CRM updates (Non-selling)
9:20-9:35: Prospect research (Selling prep)
9:35-10:15: Sales calls (SELLING!)
10:15-10:30: Notes, follow-ups (Non-selling)
10:30-11:00: Internal meeting (Non-selling)
11:00-11:45: More calls (SELLING!)
11:45-12:00: Email responses (Non-selling)

Morning: 45 min selling / 240 min = 19% 😱
