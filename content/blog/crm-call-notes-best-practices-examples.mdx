## Examples of Excellence

### Example 1: Discovery Call Notes

```markdown
## Call Summary
Spoke with CFO John Smith about their manual reporting challenges costing 20 hrs/week. Strong pain around month-end close. Budget approved for Q2 implementation if we can prove 50% time savings.

## Key Insights
- Currently using Excel for consolidation (nightmare)
- 3 acquisitions coming, need scalable solution
- CFO has buying authority up to $100k
- Competitor X failed their POC last month

## Critical Success Factors
1. Integration with their ERP (SAP)
2. Report generation under 5 minutes
3. Role-based access for 50 users

## Red Flags
- IT bandwidth limited until April
- Change management concerns from finance team

## Next Steps
- Technical validation call: March 10 with IT
- ROI workshop: March 12 with finance team
- Executive presentation: March 20
```

### Example 2: Competitive Intelligence

```markdown
## Competitive Landscape
Primary competitor: Gong
- Their strength: Brand recognition
- Their weakness: Price ($75k vs our $25k)
- Their proposal: 2-year commitment required
- Decision criteria: ROI and ease of use (we win both)

## Our Positioning
- 70% less expensive with same core features
- Implementation in days vs their months
- No long-term commitment required
- Better support model (dedicated vs pooled)

## Strategy
- Emphasize rapid time-to-value
- Provide side-by-side comparison
- Offer proof-of-concept Gong won't do
- Leverage reference customer who switched
```
