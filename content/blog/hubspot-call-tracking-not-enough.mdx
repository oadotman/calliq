# Why HubSpot Call Tracking Isn't Enough

The truth about hubspot call tracking limitations: what marketing promises vs. what you actually get, and how to bridge the gap for real results.

## The Reality Check

hubspot call tracking limitations sounds perfect in demos. The reality? Most teams discover critical limitations only after implementation. Here's what you need to know before investing.

## What hubspot call tracking limitations Promises

Marketing materials claim:
