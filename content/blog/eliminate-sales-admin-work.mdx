## Common Objections Demolished

### "Our process is unique"
Every company thinks this. AI adapts to any process better than humans forcing themselves into rigid workflows.

### "Reps need to own the data"
They'll own accurate data that appears magically, not incomplete data they grudgingly enter.

### "Management needs detailed updates"
Automation provides more detail than any human could capture, in real-time, with perfect accuracy.

### "We tried automation before"
Previous generation automation ≠ modern AI. It's like comparing a flip phone to an iPhone.

## The Psychology of Admin Elimination

### Why Reps Resist Admin Work
- Breaks flow state
- Feels like bureaucracy
- Doesn't help them personally
- Takes time from money-making activities
