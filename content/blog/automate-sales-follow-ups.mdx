4. Competition mentioned
5. Budget timeline given
6. Next steps agreed

### Step 2: Create Your Automation Rules (1 minute)

## Real Follow-Up Workflows That Convert

### The "Post-Demo Symphony"

**Hour 1:** Thank you + recording + key points
**Day 1:** Personalized recap with next steps
**Day 3:** Resource based on main concern
**Day 5:** Case study of similar company
**Day 7:** Check-in with new insight
**Day 10:** Decision timeline query
**Day 14:** Break-up email (creates urgency)

**Results:** 67% conversion vs. 23% manual

### The "Proposal Power Play"

**Immediately:** Notification of proposal opened
**Hour 2:** "Did you have a chance to review?"
**Day 1:** Address likely objection proactively

**Why It Works:**

## The AI Advantage

### What AI Extracts from Calls

- "We're evaluating until March" → Nurture campaign set

### How AI Personalizes

**Dynamic Content Insertion:**
