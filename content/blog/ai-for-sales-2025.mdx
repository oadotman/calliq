Everyone's selling AI for sales. But after $2.3 billion in venture funding and thousands of implementations, what actually works? We analyzed 500+ sales teams using AI. Here's the truth about what delivers ROI and what's just expensive noise.

## The Bottom Line for 2025

AI in sales works—when you buy the right tools for the right problems with the right expectations. The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the most tools. They're the ones who:

1. Start with clean data
2. Focus on specific problems
3. Measure real ROI
4. Train their teams properly
5. Iterate constantly

**The Truth:** AI won't magically fix your sales problems. But used strategically, it will amplify what's already working and give your team superpowers they didn't have before.

**Ready to cut through the hype?** Start with one problem. Choose proven technology. Measure everything. Scale what works. Ignore the rest.

The future of sales isn't AI or human. It's AI and human. Make sure you're building for that reality.
