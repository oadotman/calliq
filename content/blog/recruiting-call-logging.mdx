# How Recruiting Firms Can Log Candidate Calls Faster and Close More Placements

Recruiters make 50-100 calls per day, juggling candidates, clients, and requirements across dozens of open positions. Yet most spend 2+ hours daily on call notes. Here's how top firms cut that to minutes while improving placement rates.

## The Recruiter's Documentation Dilemma

### Why Traditional Logging Fails

**The Daily Reality:**
- 75+ candidate calls
- 20+ client check-ins
- 15+ reference checks
- 10+ interview debriefs
- 3 hours of note-taking
- 60% of details forgotten

**The Hidden Cost:**
- Candidates fall through cracks
- Perfect matches missed
- Client requirements forgotten
- Duplicate outreach
- Lost placement fees

### The Speed vs Quality Problem

Recruiters face an impossible choice:
- **Log everything:** Miss calling windows, lose momentum
- **Log nothing:** Forget critical details, look unprepared
- **Log later:** Forget 73% of conversation

The solution? A system that captures everything in seconds, not minutes.
