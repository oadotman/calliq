# Conversation Intelligence Without the Enterprise Price Tag

Looking for affordable conversation intelligence? You're not alone. While Enterprise Solutions is a powerful platform, its enterprise pricing and complexity often overwhelm smaller teams. Here are the best alternatives that deliver results without the headaches.

## Why Teams Seek Enterprise Solutions Alternatives

### The Price Problem
- Enterprise Solutions: Starting at $12,000/year minimum
- Hidden costs: Implementation, training, add-ons
- Annual contracts with no flexibility
- Per-seat pricing that punishes growth

### The Complexity Challenge
- 3-6 month implementation timeline
- Requires dedicated admin resources
- Overwhelming feature set for most teams
- Steep learning curve reduces adoption
