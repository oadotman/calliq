After analyzing 10,000+ sales reps' daily activities, we discovered something shocking: the top 10% don't work harder, they just lose less time to hidden productivity killers.

## The Time Audit Nobody Wants to See

We tracked every minute of 10,000 sales reps for 30 days. Here's where time really goes:

## The Top 10% Secret Strategies

### Strategy 1: Time Blocking on Steroids

**Regular Time Blocking:**

**Top 10% Time Blocking:**
