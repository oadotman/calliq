# How to Use AI Transcription for Sales Calls: The Complete Implementation Guide

AI transcription has moved from "nice to have" to "can't live without" for sales teams. But 67% of implementations fail because teams don't know how to use it properly. Here's the definitive guide to implementing AI transcription that actually drives results.

## Why AI Transcription Is Non-Negotiable

**What AI Captures:**
- 100% of conversation
- Every commitment made
- All competitors mentioned
- Each buying signal
- Complete context forever

### The ROI Is Immediate

**Time Savings:**
- Note-taking during calls: 0 minutes
- Post-call documentation: 2 min vs 15 min
